# Adishila

The font family Adishila was developed by a team led by Krishna Prasad G, with the blessings of Sri Suvidyendra Tirtha Swamiji, the fifty fourth successor of Sri Madhvacharya. The font family can be used for Sanskrit, Vedic accents, Marathi, Hindi, Nepali, and other languages which use the Devanagari script. These fonts also support roman characters with IAST diacritics.
