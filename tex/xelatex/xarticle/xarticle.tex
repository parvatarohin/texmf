Traditionally, text is composed to create a readable, coherent, and visually
satisfying typeface that works invisibly, without the awareness of the reader.
Even distribution of typeset material, with a minimum of distractions and
anomalies, is aimed at producing clarity and transparency. Choice of typeface(s)
is the primary aspect of text typography—prose fiction, non-fiction, editorial,
educational, religious, scientific, spiritual, and commercial writing all have
differing characteristics and requirements of appropriate typefaces and their
fonts or styles.
